Great! Here's an outline of the modifications and steps you'd need to implement the Room Creation feature, which would allow users to create private rooms for synchronized movie watching, in an online theater-like experience.

1. Backend Modifications
a) Room Management (API and Database)
Database Changes:

Create a Room model to store room-related data.
Fields could include:
RoomId (Unique identifier)
HostUserId (ID of the host)
RoomName (Optional, for naming the room)
CreatedDate (Timestamp for room creation)
MaxUsers (Optional, number of users allowed in a room)
MovieUrl (URL of the movie being watched in the room)
Participants (List of users currently in the room)
API Endpoints:

Create Room: API to create a new room.
Join Room: API to join an existing room.
Get Room Info: API to retrieve details about a room (e.g., list of participants, movie URL, etc.).
Leave Room: API for users to leave a room.
Delete Room: API for the host to delete the room (once all users leave, or if the host decides to end the session).
b) SignalR Modifications for Room Management
Create a Hub for Room Communication:

RoomSyncHub: Create a new SignalR hub that handles the communication between users in a room.
Each room should have its own SignalR connection to manage user synchronization independently.
When a user joins a room, they connect to the corresponding hub.
Real-Time Communication for Sync:

Handle movie synchronization (play, pause, seek), but now only for users in a specific room.
The host (creator of the room) will control playback, while others in the room can only follow along.
Ensure No Interference:

Prevent users from sending commands (like play/pause) if they are not the host of the room.
c) Authentication and Authorization
Only authenticated users can create or join rooms.
Authorization check to ensure only the host can control playback, and others can only watch in sync.
2. Frontend Modifications
a) UI for Room Creation
Room Creation Page:
A simple form where users can create a room, choose the movie, and set the room name (if desired).
Button to create the room and redirect to the room’s watch page.
Join Room Page:
A list of active rooms (or a search bar for rooms to join).
Option to join an existing room by entering a room code or selecting from the list.
b) Room Watch Page
Movie Player:

The video player should be linked to the room's movie URL (fetched dynamically from the backend).
Allow only the host to control playback (play, pause, seek). Regular users should only watch and be synchronized with the host.
Sync Control:

Use SignalR to listen for changes in playback state and update the UI accordingly.
Show the list of room participants and their statuses (e.g., playing, paused).
c) Handling User Actions in the Room:
Joining/Leaving a Room:

Automatically connect to the room's SignalR hub when a user joins.
Allow the user to leave the room at any time.
Display Room Information:

Show who the host is and the movie being watched.
Add a countdown timer for when the movie will start, if applicable.
3. Scalability and Flexibility
Allow for multiple rooms:

Ensure that different rooms can operate independently and maintain their own playback state.
Limit users per room:

Set a limit on the number of users per room if needed. For example, you could set the MaxUsers field in the room database model.
Room Cleanup:

Automatically remove inactive rooms if no one is left or if the host decides to end the session.
4. Optional Features (Future Enhancements)
Video Chat for Users in the Room: Allow participants to have a chat or video call while watching.
Emojis/Reactions: Users can send reactions like thumbs up, clapping, etc., during the movie.
Queue System: Allow the host to add movies to a queue for future sessions.
5. Testing and Deployment
Test the Room Creation Process:
Create multiple rooms, join them, leave them, and ensure synchronization works smoothly across different users.
Test Scalability:
Test how the app handles multiple rooms and users without performance degradation.
With these changes, your app will evolve into a full-featured platform for synchronized movie watching in private rooms! It’ll allow you and your users to enjoy the "online theater" experience with complete control over the session.
